1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

    I would like to make my own version of wikipedia, so basically put my own spin on
    a virtual encyclopedia to create a unique and fluid user experience. 

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

    I feel like the overall demographic for my website will be for anyone who wants 
    to learn something new. There should be no limit on information to anyone that wishes
    to better themselves through knowledge.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may not have picked an actual API yet, which is fine, just

    At the moment I am planning on making my own version of an online encyclopedia which will
    contain a plethora of information on a very wide range of topics. 

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project ( knowing that you might not know 
everything in advance and that these details might change later ). Answer questions like the
